Tumblr Photo Downloader
=======================

Ruby script to download all the photos from a Tumblr blog.

Tumblr also has a GUI backup tool for Mac, [Tumblr Backup.app](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/286303145/tumblr-backup-mac-beta)


Usage
-----

Checkout the code:

    git clone git://github.com/jamiew/tumblr-photo-downloader.git
    cd tumblr-photo-downloader

Install bundler:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

Run the script, specifying your blog URL as the argument:

    ruby tumblr-photo-downloader.rb jamiew.tumblr.com

By default, images will be saved in a sub-directory of the directory containing the script (eg tumblr-photo-downloader/jamiew.tumblr.com). If you want them to be saved to a different directory, you can pass its name as an optional second argument:

    ruby tumblr-photo-downloader.rb jamiew.tumblr.com ~/pictures/jamiew-tumblr-images/ 

If you have run the script previously, specifying the same Tumblr URL and destination directory, then it will stop after sequentially encountering links to 50 images that have been previously downloaded.
 
Enjoy!
